## 📅 Day 2 – JavaScript Basics & DOM

### ✅ What I Did

- Learned JavaScript syntax: variables, functions, arrays, and objects
- Connected my login form to JavaScript
- Captured user input using the DOM
- Built a simple login logic with hardcoded credentials
- Used `event.preventDefault()` to control form behavior

### 💻 Code Features

- `form.addEventListener('submit', handler)`
- `input.value` to read form data
- Conditional logic to simulate login
- Alert on success/failure

### 🔍 What Was Tricky

- Understanding how form events work
- Remembering to select elements with `querySelector` and `getElementById`
- Using `.value` instead of `.innerText`

### 📈 Improvements for Later

- Add form validation (e.g., empty fields)
- Style error messages dynamically
- Replace fake login with real backend auth
